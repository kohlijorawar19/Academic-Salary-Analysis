# Academic-Salary-Analysis
Project aimed at uncovering patterns, insights, and potential relationships within a dataset that includes information on academic rank, discipline, years of service, gender, and salary.  The analysis begins with a basic understanding of the datasetâ€™s structure, including the distribution of values for each category.

# Description
The script performs an exploratory data analysis on the dataset. It starts by reading the dataset from a CSV file.The script generates summary statistics for the numerical columns (years since Ph.D., years of service, and salary), providing count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values.
The script includes examples of filtering the data based on conditions. It also includes visualizations made with python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
You will need Python installed on your machine. The script uses the following Python libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Make sure these libraries are installed before running the script.

# Installing
To execute the script, navigate to the directory containing the script and type python script_name.py in your terminal, replacing script_name.py with the name of the Python script.

# Running the Tests
The script includes examples of filtering the data based on conditions, such as selecting observations with a salary greater than 120K, or selecting data for female professors. It also demonstrates how to use filtering to calculate the mean salary for discipline A.

# Breakdown of Tests
The script shows how to select a subset of rows based on their position, or select specific columns from the dataframe. It also provides examples of sorting the data frame by years of service.

# Deployment
The script can be deployed as a standalone Python script or it can be integrated into a larger data analysis pipeline.
